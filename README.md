# Bank-management-system

#### Note:
* This project is completely for learning purposes and does not represent any official banking entity. The database schema, sample data, and SQL queries provided here are fictional and are intended solely for educational use. They do not reflect any real-world banking operations or data associated with any financial institution. Use this project to enhance your understanding of SQL database management systems and to practice querying relational databases in a simulated banking environment.

### Description:
This repository contains SQL scripts for creating and populating tables for an ICIC Bank management system. The SQL queries create tables for account types, departments, bank details, job details, employees, and customers. Additionally, it includes sample data insertion and a set of SQL queries to retrieve information based on various criteria, such as employee details, department information, customer details, and more. The repository serves as a reference for building and querying a database system for managing bank operations within the ICIC Bank context.

## Key Features:

* Creation of database tables for account types, departments, bank details, job details, employees, and customers.
* Population of tables with sample data to simulate a bank management system environment.
* SQL queries for extracting specific information from the database, including employee details, department information, customer data, and more.
* Views creation for simplified access to commonly needed data subsets.
* Updates and modifications to existing data within the database tables.

## To create an ER model using MySQL Workbench (mwb file) for this file:

* Open MySQL Workbench.
* Create a new EER model.
* Design entities (tables) and relationships based on the provided database schema.
* Add attributes and constraints.
* Generate SQL scripts.
* Execute the scripts in your SQL environment.
* Review and modify as needed.
###### By following these steps, you can create an ER model to represent the database schema visually and generate SQL scripts to implement it.

## Usage:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Execute the SQL scripts in your preferred SQL environment to create tables, insert data, and run queries.
* Use the provided SQL queries as references or customize them according to your specific requirements.

## Note:
Please ensure that you have appropriate permissions and credentials for executing SQL queries in your database environment. It's recommended to review and modify the SQL scripts to suit your database schema and data requirements.
